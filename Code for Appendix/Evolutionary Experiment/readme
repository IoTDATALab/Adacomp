## Code for Genetic algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO).

(1) This includes two group experiments, 

    (i) GA for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10;
    (ii) PSO for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10;

(2) The optimizaed parameters are learning rate and momentum coefficient. 

    (i) For GA, learning rate ranges in [0.0001,0.0005, 0.001,0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3], momentum ranges in [0.45, 0.95] with step size 0.05;
    (ii) For PSO, lower and upper bounds of learning rate [0.0001, 0.3], for moementum is [0.45, 0.95].
    
(3) To run code, 

    (i) For GA, typing "python main.py" in the corresponding directory;
    (ii) For PSO, typing "python filename.py" where filiename is mnist_conv.py, fashionmnist_conv.py, cifar10_conv.py in PSO directory.
