## Code for Experiments in Appendix

1. Using more metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, to validate performance of Adacomp. 
These include code for MNIST, code for Fashion-MNIST, code for CIFAR-100.

2. Comparing Adacomp with genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm.
This include code
