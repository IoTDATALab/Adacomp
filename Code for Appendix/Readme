## Code for Experiments in Appendix

1. Using more metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, to validate performance of Adacomp. 
These include code for MNIST, code for Fashion-MNIST, code for CIFAR-100. 
The used network architecture is the same as that of parent directory. 

2. Comparing Adacomp with genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm.
This include Evolutionary Experiment.
In particular, each case is in a separate directory.
